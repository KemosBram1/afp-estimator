It appears that the Power Supply in Electrical closet 731 has a bad supervisory circuit for the monitoring of the input. If we move the resistor parallel across the input wire the FACP is happy but if we wire it through the power supply according to the drawing it goes into an open circuit. 
This power supply needs to be replaced.

                Take Down Procedure
Steps:
•Contact Control Room let them know service work is being done.
•Close Nitrogen Cylinders Valves Front and Rear
 of Turbine A, Turbine B, Generator.
(Marked 1-6)
•Remove Solenoids from Front Nitrogen     Cylinder of Turbine A, Turbine B, Generator. 
•Note- Added level of safety if desired is to remove the Front Nitrogen Cylinders discharge hose directly over the solenoids on Turbine A, Turbine B, Generator. 
(Marked with Red Paint)
——————————————————————
            (John Twitty Energy Center)
                Cylinder drain and refill
Note: Do Front bank and then do Rear bank separately. 

(Drain down)
•Remove pilot tank hoses but leave connector on cylinder.
•Attach air compressor hose and adapter connector hose.
•Remove plugs from outside discharge lines and attach discharge hose to direct the flow of water away. 
•Attach air from air compressor and blow tanks down until no water flows anymore and cycle tank air up and down with the block valve on the discharge piping to allow the air compressor to build up pressure and this will take numerous cycles. Be patient it takes a little while. Don’t remove the air supply hose until most of the water is out as the back pressure will then push water back through the hose connecting point. 
•Remove air compressor and now install smaller adapter to cylinder in the rear so the air connector fits, it has a smaller connection point on the tank. 
•Now repeat the blow down on the rear cylinders.

(Refill Front and Rear Cylinders)
GO SLOWLY IT REFILLS BETTER!!!
•Close System block valve.
•Remove pressure gauge from cylinder next to pressure switch. 
•Attach water fill hose adapter. Make sure you have the shutoff adapter attached to the end of the hose in the hut so you can control the water from inside the hut.
•Loosen all 3 indicator plugs.
•Wrap a rag or rags around the neck to catch the water as you fill each cylinder. It keeps the mess down.
•Plug the inlet on the pilot cylinder.
•Now turn water on slowly and allow air to flow through the indicators doing one at a time until the all 3 cylinders are full.
•Turn water off.
•Tighten all 3 indicator plugs and Green indicator should be up. 
•Remove water attachment and reinstall gauge.
•Remove plug from pilot tank. 
•Dry everything up and reattach regular hose connections.

Note: Do the exact same thing for the Rear but you must use the smaller adapter for plugging the initial tank. The one that you have used for the air attachment is the right one to use.
Dry all connections well to prevent standing water in the hoses and fittings.
DONT FORGET TO INSTALL THE FIELD PIPE PLUGS!! 
*Return all solenoids and open Nitrogen valves to return system to normal service.
 The whole process will take 7-8 hours.","[2025-Oct-27 12:00:35 Trish Suponchick] Agreement is based on 40 total hours - 4 nights hotel/meals - travel  ts",,,03/10/2023,false,,,,
