## Working with SharePoint?

If you're developing in SharePoint and want to deploy to Streamlit Cloud:

⚠️ **SharePoint cannot automatically push to Git.** See [SHAREPOINT_QUICK_ANSWER.md](SHAREPOINT_QUICK_ANSWER.md) for solutions.

**Recommended approach:** Develop locally with Git, use SharePoint for documents only.

```bash
# Work in your local Git folder
cd /path/to/afp-estimator
# Edit files, test, then push
git add . && git commit -m "Changes" && git push
# Auto-deploys in 1-3 minutes!
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Pandas

See `requirements.txt` for specific versions.
